# AI-LA Autonomous Daemon - True Autonomy

## What This Is

This is not an assistant you ask for help. This is an autonomous AI that runs 24/7 in the background, monitoring everything you do, learning from you, and proactively improving your code without being asked.

## How It Works

### 1. Invasive Monitoring

The daemon monitors your entire filesystem:

- **All code directories** (~/projects, ~/work, ~/code, ~/dev, ~/Documents, ~/Desktop)
- **Real-time file changes** (watches every file modification)
- **Git repositories** (analyzes your commit history)
- **Development patterns** (learns how you work)

### 2. Autonomous Learning

AI-LA learns from everything:

**From your commits:**
- Coding style (indentation, quotes, naming)
- Testing habits (do you write tests?)
- Refactoring patterns (how often you refactor)
- Bug fix patterns (how you fix issues)

**From your files:**
- Project structures you prefer
- Libraries you use
- Architectural patterns
- Error handling approaches

**From your behavior:**
- When you code (time of day)
- What you work on (project priorities)
- How you organize code
- Your workflow patterns

### 3. Proactive Actions

AI-LA doesn't wait for you to ask. It acts autonomously:

**Security Fixes:**
- Detects hardcoded passwords → Automatically suggests environment variables
- Finds eval() usage → Warns and suggests alternatives
- Spots SQL injection risks → Proposes parameterized queries
- Identifies exposed API keys → Recommends secrets management

**Code Improvements:**
- Missing tests → "Should I generate tests for this module?"
- No documentation → "Should I write docs for this project?"
- Large functions → "This function is complex. Should I refactor it?"
- Performance issues → "I found a performance bottleneck. Should I optimize?"

**Project Management:**
- Discovers all your projects automatically
- Tracks project health scores
- Suggests which projects need attention
- Identifies abandoned projects

### 4. Continuous Improvement

The more you code, the smarter AI-LA gets:

- Learns your preferences from every file change
- Adapts to your style in real-time
- Builds confidence in learned patterns
- Shares knowledge across all your projects

## Installation

- Inferred preferences

**Nothing is sent to cloud. Everything stays on your machine.**

### Controlling AI-LA

**Stop the daemon:**
```bash
# Linux
systemctl --user stop ai-la-daemon

# macOS
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ai-la.daemon.plist
```

**View what AI-LA learned:**
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.ai-la/autonomous.db "SELECT * FROM learned_patterns"
```

**View autonomous actions:**
```bash
sqlite3 ~/.ai-la/autonomous.db "SELECT * FROM autonomous_actions"
```

**Reset AI-LA's memory:**
```bash
rm ~/.ai-la/autonomous.db
# AI-LA will start learning from scratch
```

**Disable invasive mode:**
Edit `~/.ai-la/daemon-config.json`:
```json
{
  "invasive_mode": false
}
```

## Real-World Example

### Day 1: Installation

```bash
# Install daemon
./install-daemon.sh

# AI-LA starts monitoring
# Discovers 15 projects
# Analyzes 2,500 files
# Learns your style in 10 minutes
```

### Day 2: First Autonomous Action

```
You're coding a new feature...

AI-LA detects: Hardcoded API key in config.py
AI-LA suggests: "Move API key to environment variable?"
You accept.
AI-LA fixes: Automatically refactors code
AI-LA learns: You care about security
```

### Day 7: Proactive Suggestions

```
AI-LA notices: Project "api-server" has no tests
AI-LA suggests: "Should I generate tests? I learned your testing style."
You accept.
AI-LA generates: Complete test suite matching your style
AI-LA learns: You write tests for APIs
```

### Day 30: Full Autonomy

```
AI-LA knows:
- Your coding style (100% confidence)
- Your testing habits
- Your security preferences
- Your architectural patterns
- Your work schedule

AI-LA proactively:
- Fixes security issues before you notice
- Suggests features based on patterns
- Generates code matching your style perfectly
- Manages project health automatically
```

## Comparison

### Traditional AI Assistants

**GitHub Copilot:**
- You type → It suggests
- Reactive, not proactive
- No learning from your codebase
- No autonomous actions

**Cursor:**
- You ask → It answers
- Reactive, not proactive
