## Validation Features

### 1. Pre-Flight Checks (`preflight-check.sh`)

**Purpose:** Validate system before installation

**Checks:**
-  Operating system compatibility (Linux, macOS)
-  RAM requirements (8GB minimum, 16GB recommended)
-  Disk space (20GB minimum)
-  GPU detection (optional, for performance)
-  Required dependencies (curl, git, jq)
-  Network connectivity
-  Existing installations

**Output:**
- Clear pass/fail indicators
- Actionable recommendations
- Model suggestions based on hardware

### 2. Dry-Run Mode (`install-enhanced.sh --dry-run`)

**Purpose:** Preview installation without making changes

**Features:**
-  Simulates all installation steps
-  Shows what would be installed
-  No system modifications
-  Safe to run multiple times

**Example:**
```bash
./install-enhanced.sh --dry-run
# Shows: [DRY-RUN] Would install Ollama
```

### 3. Verification & Auto-Fix (`verify-and-fix.sh`)

**Purpose:** Diagnose and repair installation issues

**Capabilities:**
-  Verifies all components
-  Automatically fixes common issues
-  Interactive repair prompts
-  Health check system
-  Rollback functionality

**Auto-Fix Examples:**
- Missing Ollama → Offers to install
- No models → Suggests appropriate model
- Broken config → Regenerates automatically
- Service not running → Attempts restart

### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite (`test-install.sh`)

**Purpose:** Validate entire installation

**Test Categories:**
1. Pre-installation (syntax, JSON, permissions)
2. Installation (Ollama, models, VSCode)
3. Integration (API, inference, config)
4. Performance (script speed)
5. Security (permissions, secrets)
6. Documentation (completeness)

**Output:**
- Detailed test report
- Pass/fail summary
- Actionable fixes
- Log file for debugging

## Error Handling

### Failsafe Mechanisms

1. **Automatic Backups**
   - All configs backed up before changes
   - Timestamped backup directories
   - Easy rollback with `verify-and-fix.sh --rollback`

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Missing Ollama → Skips model installation
   - No VSCode → Skips extension installation
   - Low RAM → Installs smaller models

3. **Retry Logic**
   - Network failures → Retries with backoff
   - Service startup → Waits up to 30 seconds
   - Model download → Continues on failure

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - All actions logged to `~/.ai-coding-stack/install.log`
   - Timestamped entries
   - Error context included

### Error Recovery Examples

**Scenario 1: Ollama service won't start**
```bash
./verify-and-fix.sh
# Detects issue
# Attempts: killall ollama && ollama serve
# Verifies: Waits for API response
# Result: Service running or clear error message
```

**Scenario 2: Broken Continue config**
```bash
./verify-and-fix.sh
# Detects: Invalid JSON
# Backs up: config.json → config.json.broken
# Regenerates: New valid config
# Verifies: JSON validity check
```

**Scenario 3: Insufficient RAM**
```bash
./preflight-check.sh
# Detects: 4GB RAM (minimum 8GB)
# Recommends: Cloud-based models or RAM upgrade
# Allows: Force install with --force flag
# Installs: Smallest models only (7B)
```

## Installation Modes

### Mode 1: Standard Installation
```bash
./install-enhanced.sh
```
- Runs pre-flight checks
- Prompts for confirmation
- Installs all components
- Verifies installation

### Mode 2: Dry-Run (Preview)
```bash
./install-enhanced.sh --dry-run
```
- Shows what would be installed
- No system modifications
- Safe exploration

### Mode 3: Force Installation
```bash
./install-enhanced.sh --force
```
- Bypasses pre-flight checks
- Continues despite warnings
- For advanced users

### Mode 4: Skip Pre-Flight
```bash
./install-enhanced.sh --skip-preflight
```
- Skips validation
- Faster installation
- Assumes system is ready
